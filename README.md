This project includes multiple RNG algorithms such as LCG, SplitMix64, Xoroshiro, PCG, SFC64, WyRand, and more. The goal is to provide a hands-on toolkit for learning about PRNG design, evaluating randomness, and exploring vulnerabilities.

- **Multiple PRNG implementations**
  - LCG
  - SplitMix64
  - Xoroshiro128+
  - Xoroshiro128**
  - Xoroshiro256++
  - Xoshiro256**
  - Xoshiro512++
  - PCG32
  - SFC64
  - WyRand

- **State recovery / cracking experiments**
  - Demonstrates how PRNG outputs can be analyzed to recover seeds or internal state.
